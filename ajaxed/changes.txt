v 1.0

- ajaxedPage has a plain- and title-property
- moved configuration to /ajaxedConfig ... this makes the updating process easier
	- you need to create a folder called "ajaxedConfig" and move the config.asp from "ajaxed" folder to there
	- moreover put a header.asp and footer.asp into the ajaxedConfig folder as well
- footer and header added
	- footer.asp and header.asp can be found in "ajaxedConfig". Modify them as you wish
- ajaxedPage.defaultStructure property added. With this its possible to load a page with a default header and footer. thus they are not loaded from the ajaxedConfig then
	- this is here if you need a valid HTML document but dont really care about the nitty gritty stuff.
- MD5 hash class added
- lib.fso property added. for quick access to the filesystemobject
- lib.getFunction() gives the possibility to get a function by name and the possibility to check if it exists
- lib.exec() function added. with this you can call a function if it exists. if not then its not called
	- good usage is e.g. in the header.asp when you want to execute something within the head-tag on some pages
	- the init() sub does not necessarily need to be included. just leave it if you dont use it
- str.parse returns a string if alternative type is a string .. before it throwed exception
- str.matching for quick execution of regex
- implemented environments support. lib.env returns the current environment. LIVE is production and DEV is development
	- by default its always development
	- AJAXED_ENVIRONMENT can be set in the config.asp
	- lib.DEV and lib.LIVE are helpers to indicate the environment
	- ajaxedPage.onlyDev property can protect pages against being available on the live environment
	- tests cannot be run by default on the live environment (security reason)
	- if you run /test/ then it looks for tests everywhere on the server. testfiles must start with "test_" and have the extension .asp
- TestFixture class added. Its possible to write tests now. Tests for the library are available and you can write your own for your applications
	- Fixture is implemented as other common fixtures on the market
- Cache class added. With it you can cache data which is "expensive" to get. see webdevbros.net for a tutorial about it.
- error is now thrown if there is no main() sub in the page. 
- created an own ajaxed console which is a place for tools for the developer
	- available through /ajaxed/console/ and only on the DEV environment.
	- contains a regular expression tool
	- contains the documentor which creates documentation for VBScript classes
- documentation works now in FF and IE. formatting has been updated a bit. and printing is nicer as well
- db.insert, db.update, db.count, db.delete, db.toggle added
	- makes code nicer and quick CRUD operations easier
- added TextTemplate component. It parses templates. Useful for sending emails (email component will follow)
- lib.contains added. checks if a given value exists in an array or dictionary

v 0.3

[18 December, 2007]
- working with prototype 1.6
- working with JSON utility class 1.4
	- there used to be an error when returning custom objects which were processed recursively. it resulted in outputing only '}'
	- vartype = 19 is undocumented but comes as integer from mysql. this vartype is treated as integer now
	- vartype 7 added which was not recognized as float
- loading indicator has no styles applied anymore.. they need to be defined by you in your css file by definined the css class 'ajaxLoadingIndicator'
	if you want back the old style, then put this into your global stylesheet
		.ajaxLoadingIndicator {
			background-color: #cc0000;
			color: #fff;
			margin:2px;
			right: 0px;
		}
- more test have been added (also for recordsets)
- added AJAXED_DBCONNECTION to the config.asp => you can open the DB connection automatically now for each page by default
- loading indicator stays now always on top of the screen. before it used to disappear if page scroll was not at the top
- renamed demo/index.asp to demo/default.asp because iis default installation has this already set

v 0.2

[8 July, 2007]
- added a "Database" class which offers functionality to work with databases.
- prototypejs: using version 1.5.1.1 instead of 1.5.1_rc1 now
- AjaxedPage.iif, AjaxedPage.error, AjaxedPage.throwError are obsolete and use the appropriate library methods now.
- added a "library" class which holds "global" and general functions which are needed through the whole library. check the documentation for new functions
- added a "stringOperations" class which adds a lot of additional and useful string manipulation functions to the library
- created a "test" folder which holds unit tests for the library.
- created a folder "prototypejs" and moved the prototype JavaScript library there
- created a folder for each VBScript class (class_ajaxedPage, class_JSON). Prefixed the folder with "class_"
